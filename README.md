# acorn-node

[Acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn) preloaded with plugins for syntax parity with recent Node versions.

It also includes versions of the plugins compiled with [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel), so they can be run on old Node versions (0.6 and up).

## Install

```
npm install acorn-node
```

## Usage

```js
var acorn = require('acorn-node')
```

The API is the same as [acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn), but with plugins to match Node.js behaviour.

- Currently no plugins are in use as the main `acorn` branch supports the same syntax as Node.js.

The following options have different defaults from acorn, to match Node modules:

 - `ecmaVersion: 2022`
 - `allowHashBang: true`
 - `allowReturnOutsideFunction: true`

```js
var walk = require('acorn-node/walk')
```

The Acorn syntax tree walker. Comes preconfigured for the syntax plugins if necessary.
See the [acorn documentation](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn#distwalkjs) for details.
